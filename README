Resizer v0.1-beta - example web application for batch image resizing.

Images are uploaded and resized, packaged in a zip file and sent to the user.
This example is limited to 5 images of max 2MB each.

It should be run on Linux/Apache. :)

Uses jQueryUI for frontend, uploadify for multiple file upload and custom
Nya_Image and Nya_File classes.

Nya_Image uses GD library since the idea was that this application should
work on most shared host machines which usually don't have ImageMagick.

Demo can be seen on
