Example web application for batch image resizing.

It should be run on Linux/Apache.

Uses jQueryUI for frontend, uploadify for multiple file upload and custom
Nya_Image and Nya_File classes.

Files are uploaded, stored in a directory created for current user,
and then resized using a generated bash script which allows the application to
display progress bar of image resizing and to resize a number of images 
while avoiding hanging of script if all images would be resized by one request.

Nya_Image uses GD library since the idea was that this application should
work on most shared host machines which usually don't have ImageMagick.

It's in beta stage which means it should only be run on a local machine,
not as a web service (yet) :)
